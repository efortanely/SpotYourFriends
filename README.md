# SpotYourFriends

# Inspiration
SpotYourFriends was inspired by the need for making playlists for road trips or parties that everyone would enjoy! We hope people can realize how much they have in common!

# What it does
Our web app allows multiple Spotify users to create a combined playlist using songs that all parties have in their library.

# How we built it
We leveraged Spotipy, Flask, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create the web form that the user interacts with to make changes to their playlist, and the back-end that interacts with the Spotify API.

# Challenges we ran into
It was challenging getting Spotipy to work with their required permissions, as well as getting the front-end to behave as we designed.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're really happy that we got a polished tool and that it works as it's supposed to (for the most part!)

# What we learned
We learned about Spotipy and more about Flask.

# What's next for SpotYourFriends
We want to focus on having a more sleek API and fixing any bugs.
